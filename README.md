## Implementation

![Friday Architecture](architecture.png)

Invoice-Hub consists of a front-end web application and a back-end API. The front-end and back-end are built with Next.js. The AI service is hosted on AWS Lambda and makes use of AWS Textract, OpenAI and proprietary algorithms. The front-end and back-end are hosted on Vercel.

Our codebase is structured as follows:
- `ml/` contains the AI service code
    - It contains a `setup_artifact.sh` file which compresses the code and the dependencies into a zip file for deployment to AWS Lambda.
    - `models.py` contains the core logic for the AI service.
    - `lambda_function.py` contains the code for the AWS Lambda function.

- `src/dashboard` and `src/pages`contains the front-end code and `src/components` contain the React Components powering our frontend.
- `src/pages/api` contains the back-end code which handles the parsing of the documents and the communication with the AI service.
